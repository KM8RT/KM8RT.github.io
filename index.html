        <h2 id="introheader">Introduction</h2>

        <p>Historically, Blue Note has principally been associated with the
          "hard bop" style of jazz (mixing bebop with other forms of music
          including soul, blues, rhythm and blues and gospel), but also recorded
           essential albums in the avant-garde and free styles of jazz. Horace
           Silver, Jimmy Smith, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Art Blakey,
           Grant Green, Hank Mobley, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Hutcherson, and
           Jackie McLean were among the label's leading artists. During its
           heyday, the 1950s and 1960s, the photography and graphic art of
           Reid Miles created a series of iconic album covers, often
           incorporating session photos by Francis Wolff, which added to
           Blue Note's artistic reputation.  </p>
